Once upon a time in a scary forest
There was a scary tree that could talk
One day a princess on a mission passed through
The mission involved trying to find some walnuts whilst not getting scared. 
To find the walnuts the princess had to go deep into the forrest and talk to the wicked witch
The princess was super pissed off because she forgot her ipod and she didn't even like walnuts anyway....
